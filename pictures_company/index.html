                History of the company: Pictures Company was founded in 2010 by Matías Schvindt,
                an amateur photographer, in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
                From a very young age, Matías was interested in the visual arts and was fascinated by photography.
                His grandfather Roberto gave him his first camera at the age of 13, 
                that was the beginning of his adventure, which has been going on for many years and experiences.
                Today he works with a team of professionals.  </p>
