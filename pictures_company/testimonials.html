            <h2>Rebecca and John</h2>
            <p> When we confirmed with Pictures Company to be the company in charge of our wedding,
                we did not know her or have references to her, beyond the photos we saw on her Instagram and website,
                so it was a gamble. Today we already see the wedding and pre-wedding photos, 
                and they are photos that we would never have thought to have in our lives.
                Those looks that last a second, the smiles of complicity, 
                the hugs and all the love that there was that night were immortalized in the photos. </p>

            <p> From the moment we contacted Pictures Company until the delivery of the project, 
                everything has been 100% efficient!!! Also, we feel super comfortable with the camera pointing everywhere. 
                What we would like to highlight about the photography work of Pictures Company is that they love to immortalize moments without many poses, 
                that is why the photographs are very natural, well lived and with much more personality. 
                Deliveries were fast. Honestly, highly recommended! Very professional. </p>

            <p> Pictures Company took the photographs of my pregnancy, 
                I hired the company based on the opinions I read on its website, 
                and it turned out to be a success, a very professional company. 
                He took us to nearby places, but unknown and very beautiful, 
                where the photographer managed to take some film photos. </p>

            <p>  A professional service like the top of a pine tree! On my wedding day, 
                he knew how to capture every gesture and every look, turning them into unique memories. 
                Especially brilliant as a portrait and business/product photographer. 
                You will not regret hiring their services.  </p>
